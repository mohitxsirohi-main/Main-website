But after a year, I realized that the course and I weren't exactly a match made in heaven, so I moved on. Back in Nepal, I thought, 'Why not give it another go?' and took on another 'toughest exam,' the IOE entrance. Cracked that too, got into Kathmandu Engineering College… and dropped out again. Guess sometimes you just have to accept that not everything’s meant for everyone, right? Haha! </p>

                <h2>How learning happens through teaching</h2>
                <p class="blog-date">Published on: October 1, 2024</p> <!-- Blog date -->
                <p>Today I completed my first term of teaching Graduate Diploma of Management and this teaching experience has somehow changed my approach in learning.

                    Up until a few months ago, I had only experienced learning by being a student of something. It was very amusing to see that learning can happen from teaching as well.
                    
                    I started with teaching just one student on the first day of my class. I felt nervous as with just one student, the class would be very boring and too much of just me talking and the student losing attention after a few minutes in the class.
                    
                    But to my surprise, it was quite the opposite. The whole class felt like a conversation and the course content became our motion of debate. It took me back to my teen years when I started a project called Learning Beyond the Walls. I got a little emotional remembering it.
                    
                    It was beautiful to see how we went beyond the mere content on the screen and went into the depths of our creative knowledge vault to find an answer that represents our version of the concept. And that day, we both learned a lot of things from each other.
                    
                    At the end of the class, my student shared with me that she wants to start a cleaning business and I told her I want to scale my startup of carbon trading. Now we both are working on our respective projects. I am helping her with her market research and preparing initial reports for the business. Learned a bit about cleaning business in the process.
                    
                    Also, remember how our teachers used to tell us, ASK QUESTIONS. Our teachers were right, there is no such thing as a wrong or right question. Questions fuel learning and I’m grateful for all the teachers who encouraged us to challenge the standard. So, always ask questions (And be creative while at it).
                    
                    Now, the number of students has gone significantly up for my next batch. I hope even with more people, our class feels like a conversation and the learning extends beyond the screens and the walls. Let the learning never stop.
                    
                    An ode to Learning Beyond the Walls!</p>

                <h2>The Beauty of Multiculturism</h2>
                <p class="blog-date">Published on: Oct 16, 2024</p> <!-- Blog date -->
                <p>On 16 Oct 2024, I was invited to the Parliament House of South Australia by Hon. Zoe Bettison MP and the Ministry of Multicultural Affairs to celebrate Dashain, one of the most important festivals in Nepalese culture.

                    While attending this event, a guru (Hindu spiritual teacher) from our community explained to us the significance of Dashain and how during this festival, receiving red tika (a sectarian mark) symbolizes the power and blessings of goddess Durga, marking strength, victory, and protection. With rice and yogurt, it represents purity and prosperity which unites generations in a moment of deep respect and connection. He also explained about white tika, often applied by elders in some families, signifying peace, wisdom, and a calm spirit, offering a more serene form of blessing. 
                    
                    While he was sharing this with everyone, I felt a feeling like never before. Suddenly, I remembered a moment from when I was around 12 years old, when my grandfather shared the significance of this festival with me. In front of me were a group of kids, mostly born or raised in Australia, listening to this story with so much curiosity. At that moment, it is fair to say that I was one among those kids. 
                    
                    Years from now, one of those kids from the group might stand where I stood, carrying forward the traditions that have traveled oceans and generations. They’ll perhaps share with their own children the stories of Dashain just as my grandfather did with me. This child, fully grown with Australian heritage yet woven with the rich threads of Nepalese culture, will pass on these tales, showing the beauty of multiculturalism.
                    
                    Every tradition adds a colorful thread to our world, celebrating the beauty of our differences, yet bringing us closer together.</p>
